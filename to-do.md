# To do list

**Bold** are prioritized tasks.

## Execution

- [ ] Experiments with different ropes (materials,lengths,etc.)
- [ ] Verification of V shape Validity (side view video)
      a) [ ] Experiments for catenary curve shape and equation validation
      b) [ ] Verification of V shape enclosure

## Visualization

- [ ] Visualize the V shape dynamically (plot Overlay)
- [x] Visualize V shape frame along the drones while moving (all synchronised)

## Planning

- [x] Realtime Cylinders with different orientations
- [ ] Make all ROS_ERRORS into ROS_INFO (for debugging) in order to know all the real errors
- [ ] Chexk if changing the sign of dstart have better effects
- [ ] Use checkAndRepair() function first instead of replanning

## Writing

- [-]Find a better way of naming the whole degrees of freedom reducing mechanism
