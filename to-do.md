# To do list

**Bold** are prioritized tasks.

## Execution

- [ ] Experiments with different ropes (materials,lengths,etc.)
- [ ] Verification of V shape Validity (side view video)
      a) [ ] Experiments for catenary curve shape and equation validation
      b) [ ] Verification of V shape enclosure

## Visualization

- [ ] Visualize the V shape dynamically (plot Overlay)

## Planning

- [ ] ~~Execute trajectory going to first waypoint of trajectory~~ (not necessary )
- [ ] Realtime Cylinders with different orientations

## Writing

- [ ]Find a better way of naming the whole degrees of freedom reducing mechanism
